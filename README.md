Lov
===
Lov<sup>[loÀêv]</sup> is a library aimed at making permission requests on Android simple.

Usage
=====
Using the object directly:
```kotlin
Lov.requestPermissions(context, permissions)
        .subscribe({ if (it.granted) { /* Permission was granted */ } })
```
Or use the Context extension method to drop the `Lov`.

Show rationale when needed:
```kotlin
Lov.addRationale(permission,
                 PermissionRationale(R.string.rationale_title,
                                     R.string.rationale_ok,
                                     R.string.rationale_cancel,
                                     R.string.rationale_message))
```

Of course you can call Lov from Java, just use `Lov.INSTANCE`.
